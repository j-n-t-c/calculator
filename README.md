WANT TO DO:
//add backspace
have a decimal automatically put '0' before it when it should. had to remove this functionality because
I couldn't get it to work without affecting numerical input and if...else if statements were getting
out of hand so I gave up and removed it
//change display so total comes up separate from previous input number. should 'fade' last input maybe. also,
should be obvious via a 'blink' or some notation that a new number was entered if second number is same (6 + 6 for example)
NOTES: 
when changing item.innerHTML in JS, if there is already something inside (div inside a div for example), it will use that. so try not to calculate based off display.innerHTML in future because now you can't have alternate things inside
